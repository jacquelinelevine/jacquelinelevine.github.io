    <h2>Venice</h2>
    <p>My first city I ever visited in Europe. The canals were pretty cool to look at, and I went into a bunch of designer shops, but honestly, it was not my favorite city in Europe. It was hot and confusing. We did have some good Italian food and took a gondola ride down the canal (did you know they don't actually sing to you?)! Though we had our fun, it was a good thing we only stayed in Venice for 2 days because by the end of those 2 days, we were ready to hit the road onto our next destination: Florence! </p>

    <h2>Florence</h2>
    <p>The next stop on the trip was Florence. We took a beautiful train ride through the countryside from Venice to Florence, which is in Tuscany. Florence was my favorite city in Italy by far. The architecture was to die for, and it almost felt like Florence was the "New York City of Italy". The Duomo was absolutely breathtaking, and pictures do not do it justice. Our time in Florence went by way too quickly. If you can only visit one city in Italy, this would be my pick!</p>

    <h2>Rome</h2>
    <p>You know what they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans. The food in Rome was definitely my favorite food of the entire trip. I had homemade spaghetti, the best pizza I've had in my life, and this Italian sandwich that had Italian meats smothered in marinara sauce (my mouth is watering as I write this). I thought Miami was humid, but boy was I wrong. Rome had the hottest, most humid, and most uncomfortable weather ever! Besides the weather, we went to the Forum and the Colloseum (it was disturbing), and we walked over to the Vatican. Though our time in Rome was short, I will always remember my trip.</p>

    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>My favorite European city! Actually, Paris has to be my favorite city outside of the United States by far! I found out that I love the French architecture, and all of the gold detailing. What was so cool about our trip to Paris however, was that France won the World Cup while we were there. The celebration continued for 2 days, and it was so wild that we couldn't even get a taxi to go to the Eiffel Tower. We figured out the metro system so we could go see the Eiffel Tower, and we climbed both levels and then took the elevator the rest of the way up. What a view!</p>

    <h2>Cabo San Lucas</h2>
    <p>Being from San Diego, Mexico is an easy place to get away. In Cabo, I have gone ziplining and off-roading. Something not many people expect from me is that I am a big fan of off-roading. However, my favotire thing to do in a tropical place is to kick back by the pool for hours and just soak up the sun and read my book. I like to also reflect on myself and life and just be content in the moment. </p>
