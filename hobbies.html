      <h2>Working Out</h2>
        <p>Working out at the gym is one of my favorite ways to blow off steam after a long day. Benefits to working out include better heart health, feeling happier and more accomplished, and more productivity. Personally, my favorite workout routine is using the elliptical machine for about 30 minutes. After, I head over to the dumbells to add some resistance into my training. My favorite type of resistance workout is working my abdomen. If you are just getting started to ab workouts, I recommend crunches, sit ups, and leg ups.</p>

        <h2>Yoga</h2>
          <p>If working out just isn't your thing, try yoga. Many people are unaware of the benefits that yoga holds. Yoga does not just strengthen your body all over, but it also teaches its participants better flexibility, posture, and breathing. I personally love yoga because it allows me to really think and reflect on my day, goals, life, and relationships. I recently learned that how you handle poses on your yoga mat is how are you responding and reacting to issues and circumstances in your life. Pretty interesting, huh?</p>

        <h2>Baking</h2>
          <p>Opposite of working out is eating! Baking is a great way to relieve stress and enjoy a tasty treat while you are at it. My favorite desserts to bake are cookies and brownies. I like to make baking a social activity by inviting my friends over for a study and baking session where we bake together, catch up, and enjoy our treats while we study and grind away!</p>
