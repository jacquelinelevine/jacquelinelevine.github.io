  <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jacqueline, and I am 22 years old. I am a graduating senior at the University of Miami earning my degree in Broadcast Journalism and Marketing.</p>

  <p>In the fall, I will be embarking on a new journey, law school. I will be earning my Juris Doctor from St. Thomas University School of Law. Luckily, I will be staying right here in beautiful Miami, Florida!</p>

  <p>Originally, I am from San Diego, California. I have a younger sister named Danielle who is going to be a senior in high school next year! I also have two Dutch Shepherds named Nikki and Yogi. Some of my favorite things to talk about are my dogs, my favorite types of music, and rom com movies.</p>
